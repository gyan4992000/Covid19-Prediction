# New-Covid19-Project
Healthcare project
Dataset imported from DsrScientist repository
This model performs an analysis of COVID-19 data using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
1. Data Loading and Exploration: The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading COVID-19 data from an online source using pd.read_csv(). It then prints the tail of the data, its shape, checks for missing values, describes the data, and examines unique values in each column.
2. Data Preprocessing: The code separates the date into year, month, and day columns, drops unnecessary columns like 'Date' and 'Year', applies label encoding to convert country names into numerical values, and checks for data skewness.
3. Outlier Detection and Handling: Skewness is addressed by applying log transformation, and outliers are identified using box plots and interquartile range (IQR). The outliers are capped in the 'Confirmed' column.
4. Feature Scaling: Standard scaling is applied to independent variables ('x') using StandardScaler().
5. Model Building and Evaluation:
    The code then proceeds to split the data into training and testing sets.
    Various regression models are imported (LinearRegression, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor) and trained on the training data.
    Training scores are calculated for each model to evaluate their performance.
    Predictions are made on the testing set using each model, and testing scores are calculated.
6. Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning: Cross-validation scores are calculated for RandomForestRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor. Then, hyperparameter tuning is performed on RandomForestRegressor using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.
7. Final Model: The best parameters obtained from hyperparameter tuning are used to train a new RandomForestRegressor model (rf1). The final model's accuracy is evaluated using the testing set.
8. Conclusion: The final model's accuracy is reported as the conclusion of the analysis.
